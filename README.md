# FlappyBirdPracticeBuild
This is a rendition of the famous Flappy Bird project from the early to mid 2010's.

The player first runs the code from whatever IDE you choose. The game will start immediately after the program starts running, so prepare your fingers on the navigation keys(up, down, left and right keys).

Thanks to Kenny Yip Coding for the opprtunity to test my GUI making skills using swing.
